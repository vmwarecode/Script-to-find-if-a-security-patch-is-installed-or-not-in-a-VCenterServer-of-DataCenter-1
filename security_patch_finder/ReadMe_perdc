What the script does:
=====================
1. Connects to the VC server
2. Creates a patch baseline with the bulletinID provided
3. Gets the Datacenter inventory object based on the input(Datacenter_name) provided by the user and attaches the baseline to that datacenter
4. Tests the compliance of the objects under that datacenter against the baseline attached in the previous step
5. Reads the compliance status from the datacenter against the baseline
6. Detaches the baseline from the datacenter
7. Once the tests are done, if the baseline is created by the script, the baseline will be deleted, else it will be retained
8. Disconnect the session from VC

Parameter Details:
==================

-VC_IP  		- IP/Hostname of the vCenter Server 
-User   		- Username of the vCenter Server 
-Password 	- Username of the vCenter Server
-BaselineName    - Name to be given to the baseline. Can be any string, Example : security-baseline
-Datacenter_name - Name of the datacenter where the baseline is to be attached for the check
-BulletinID      - Bulletin ID to be verified, Example : ESXi650-201912104-SG


Command to use the script:
==========================

vum_test_per_dc.ps1 -VC_IP <VC_IP> -User <User> -Password <Password> -BaselineName security-baseline -Datacenter_name <Datacenter_name> -BulletinID ESXi650-201912104-SG



Sample Execution output:
========================

cmdlet vum_test_perdc.ps1 at command pipeline position 1
Supply values for the following parameters:
Datacenter_name: 1-datacenter-7

Name                           Port  User
----                           ----  ----
x.x.x.x                 443   VSPHERE.LOCAL\Administrator

The baseline security-baseline exists. No need to create. Will proceed with attaching the baseline

The datacenter name is 1-datacenter-7 and it is present in the VC : x.x.x.x. Proceeding with test compliance

The baseline security-baseline is attached. Proceeding with test compliance

The test compliance worked. Will go ahead and get the status



Baseline          Entity           Status
--------          ------           ------
security-baseline x.x.x.x Compliant



Baseline          Entity                             Status
--------          ------                             ------
security-baseline x.x.x.x NotCompliant



Baseline          Entity            Status
--------          ------            ------
security-baseline x.x.x.x NotCompliant



Baseline          Entity              Status
--------          ------              ------
security-baseline x.x.x.x NotCompliant



Baseline          Entity             Status
--------          ------             ------
security-baseline x.x.x.x NotCompliant



The test is complete. Proceeding with detaching the baseline security-baseline from the datacenter 1-datacenter-7

Successfuly detached the baseline security-baseline from the datacenter 1-datacenter-7

 The baseline security-baseline was not created by this script, hence not deleting it

 All in all , in the vc : x.x.x.x, Datacenter: 1-datacenter-7  there are a total of 4 non-compliant hosts. And they are (host1_ip, host2_ip, host3_ip, host4_ip)



 Done with script execution, Disconnecting from VC: x.x.x.x
